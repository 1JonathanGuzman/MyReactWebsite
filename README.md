Welcome to the source code for my react website!

This project was developed using vite, Vue, Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS. 

This is my first attempt at creating a website. The developed the source code here by using the following resources:
  - The tools I gained while progressing through the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate program on Coursera
  - Multiple YouTube videos
  - CoPilot and ChatGPT 4o for general questions and debugging assistance
  - General programming and development knowledge from completing my BA

Thank you for taking the time to look at my work
