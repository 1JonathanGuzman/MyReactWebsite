Welcome to the source code for my react website!

This project was developed using vite, Vue, Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS. 

This is my first attempt at creating a website. The developed the source code here by using the following resources:

  - The tools I gained while progressing through the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate program on Coursera
  - Multiple YouTube videos
  - CoPilot and ChatGPT 4o for general questions and debugging assistance
  - General programming and development knowledge from completing my BA

Thank you for taking the time to look at my work

Instructions for running this website on your machine (localhost):

  Getting dependencies:

    This project runs using Node.js, NPM and Vite, and all will need to be
    installed on your machine if you would like to run this web application
    locally.
    
    Install Node.js on your platform here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
    Doing so will give you access to the "node" and "npm" command.
  
    You can install Vite on Linux systems using "sudo apt install vite". If you
    are on a Windows machine using Visual Studio Code, "vite" should be available
    to you already if you have Node.js and NPM installed.

  Installation:
  
    You will first want to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the inside of the "ReactPortfolio" folder. Inside this folder,
    you should see the "package.json" file, which will contain the necessary
    dependencies for this project. Your current working directory should look 
    like this:
  
      ./MyReactWebsite/ReactPortfolio
  
    Next, use the command "npm install" on your terminal while in the directory 
    listed above.

    Afterwards, run the command "npm run dev", and it should run the application
    locally on a development environment. In the console output, it will tell you
    the location you can find the app, and it will look something like this:

    https://localhost:<Port Number>

    Copy and paste that location into your browser, and view the website locally!
